	<h2>What constitutes a creative web project?</h2>
	<p> A creative web project uses eye-catching, engaging, and interactive means to distribute information to an audience. A creative project uses visually aesthetic tactics to draw the viewer in. Using things like art, data visualization, games, and audio/video narrative storytelling are some examples on how to attract an audience because the webpage doesn't simply state the information, but rather shows it.</p>
