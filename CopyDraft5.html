	<h1 class="title">The Satanic Verses</h1>
	<div class="excerpt1" id="excerpt1-description">On the last night of his life he heard a noise like a <span style="font-variant: small-caps;font-size: 150%; color: red;">giants</span> crushing a forest beneath his feet, and smelled a <span style="color: lightgreen;font-style: italic">stench</span> like the giant's fart, and he realized that the tree was burning. He got out of his chair and staggered <span style="color: blueviolet;font-style: italic">dizzily</span> down to the garden to watch the <span style="color: orange;font-style: italic">fire</span>, whose flames were consuming histories, memories, genealogies, purifying the <span style="color: green;font-style: italic;">earth</span>, and coming towards him to set him free; -- because the <span style="color: skyblue;font-style: italic">wind</span> was blowing the fire towards the grounds of the mansion, so soon enough, soon enough, it would be his turn.</div> <br>

	<div class="excerpt2" id="excerpt2-description">He saw the tree explode into a <span style="color: darkred;font-weight: bolder;">thousand</span> fragments, and the trunk crack, like a <span style="color: red;font-style: italic">heart</span>; then he turned away and reeled towards the place in the garden where Ayesha had first caught his eye; -- and now he felt a <span style="color: sandybrown;font-weight: lighter;">slowness</span> come upon him, a great <span style="color: darkolivegreen;font-weight: bold">heaviness</span>, and he lay down on the withered dust. Before his eyes closed he felt something brushing at his lips, and saw the little cluster of <span style="color: mediumpurple;font-style: italic">butterflies</span> struggling to enter his mouth.</div> <br>

	<div class="excerpt3" id="excerpt3-description">Then the <span style="color: blue;font-style: italic">sea</span> poured over him, and he was in the water beside Ayesha, who had stepped miraculously out of his wife's body . .. <span style="color: indianred;font-weight: bolder;">"Open,"</span> she was crying. "Open wide!" Tentacles of light were flowing from her navel and he chopped at them, <span style="color: darkorange;font-style: italic">chopped</span>, using the side of his hand. "Open," she screamed. "You've come this far, now do the rest." -- <span style="color: darkcyan;font-style: italic">How could he hear her voice?</span> -- They were under water, lost in the roaring of the sea, but he could hear her clearly, they could all hear her, that voice like a bell. "Open," she said. <span style="color: red;font-style: italic">He closed.</span></div><br>
